import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

**The inline `<style>` block** — prevents a flash of white before React loads by setting the background to your dark navy color immediately. Without this the page briefly flashes white on load.

**The fonts `<link>` tags** — preloads Space Mono and Barlow Condensed from Google Fonts before React even runs, so the text renders in the right font immediately instead of swapping in late.

**The emoji favicon** — puts a ❄️ in the browser tab using a tiny inline SVG, no image file needed.

Your final `src/` folder should look like:
```
src/
├── main.jsx               ← mounts React into #root
└── OlympicsDashboard.jsx  ← your dashboard component
